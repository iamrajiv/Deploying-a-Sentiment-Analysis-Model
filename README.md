<h1>Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model</h1>
</div>

## Project Overview

In this project, I have constructed a recurrent neural network to determine the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I have created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. Also, I have deployed my model and constructed a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

## SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
